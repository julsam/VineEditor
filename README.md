# Vine Editor

Dialogue editor for the [VineScript language](https://github.com/julsam/VineScript). Forked from the excellent [Yarn Editor](https://github.com/InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn), which itself is heavily inspired by and based on the amazing Twine software: http://twinery.org/

This is yet a WIP

# Build from source

With node.js / npm already installed, first install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then either run the app from source, without building an executable:
```
npm start
```

Or build the app unpacked, it produces an executable for your current platform:
```
npm run build
```

Alternatively you can build the app and an installer for it:
```
npm run dist
```

# TODO
 * more explanations
 * update the screenshots
